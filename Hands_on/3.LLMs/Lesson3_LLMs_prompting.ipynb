DeepSeek has caused quite a stir in the AI world this week by demonstrating capabilities competitive with – or in some cases, better than – the latest models from OpenAI, while purportedly costing only a fraction of the money and compute power to create. DeepSeek models and their derivatives are all available for public download on Hugging Face, a prominent site for sharing AI/ML models. Did DeepSeek steal data to build its models? OpenAI recently accused DeepSeek of inappropriately using data pulled from one of its models to train DeepSeek. More About the DeepSeek Models'},\n",

DeepSeek focuses on developing open source LLMs. The company's first model was released in November 2023. Since the company was created in 2023, DeepSeek has released a series of generative AI models. Released in January 2025, this model is based on DeepSeek-V3 and is focused on advanced reasoning tasks directly competing with OpenAI's o1 model in performance, while maintaining a significantly lower cost structure. The low-cost development threatens the business model of U.S. tech companies that have invested billions in AI. In contrast with OpenAI, which is proprietary technology, DeepSeek is open source and free, challenging the revenue model of U.S. companies charging monthly fees for AI services.\"},\n",

We have a breakthrough new player on the artificial intelligence field: DeepSeek is an AI assistant developed by a Chinese company called DeepSeek. Earlier in January, DeepSeek released its AI model, DeepSeek (R1), which competes with leading models like OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT o1. What sets DeepSeek apart is its ability to develop high-performing AI models at a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek is making headlines for its performance, which matches or even surpasses top AI models. While Trump called DeepSeek\\'s success a \"wakeup call\" for the US AI industry, OpenAI told the Financial Times that it found evidence DeepSeek may have used its AI models for training, violating OpenAI\\'s terms of service.

That means DeepSeek was supposedly able to achieve its low-cost model on relatively under-powered AI chips.
