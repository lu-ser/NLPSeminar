        "In this notebook, we'll build a Question-Answering system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and the Mistral language model. The system will answer multiple-choice questions about a document on Natural Language Processing.\n",
        "## What we'll build\n",
        "Our system will:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Process a PDF document about NLP developments\n",
        "- Create a vector database for efficient information retrieval\n",
        "-Use Mistral to generate accurate answers to multiple-choice questions\n",
        "- Evaluate the answers against provided correct responses\n",
        "\n",
        "### Technical Components\n",
        "\n",
        "- Document Processing: PDF extraction and text chunking\n",
        "- Vector Storage: Document embeddings and retrieval\n",
        "- Language Model: Mistral for answer generation\n",
        "- RAG Pipeline: Combining retrieval and generation\n",

        "- How to implement a RAG system from scratch\n",
        "- Techniques for processing and chunking PDF documents\n",
        "- Methods for creating and managing vector embeddings\n",
        "- Integration of Mistral LLM for question answering\n",
        "- Best practices for prompt engineering with multiple-choice questions\n",
